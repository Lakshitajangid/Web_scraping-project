I need a 3D model of a male and female orc for my game.
I attached some concept ideas to better tell what I want.
Basically I want a orc with some fur armor for the cold. I want something realistic and not so extravagant as you normally find for orcs.

Is super necessary that the 3D models are fully rigged and ready to be animated, with no bugs in the mesh when moving the character limbs.

I also need the face to be rigged, so I can add facial expressions and talking animations.

For the male orc, I would like a standard axe and a bow.
For the female orc, I want only a bow and a dagger.
